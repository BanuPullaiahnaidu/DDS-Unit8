## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


#Read the Beers and Breweries data files in csv format
```{r}
Beers = read.csv(file.choose())
Breweries = read.csv(file.choose())
```

```{r}
#install.packages("codebook")
library(codebook)
codebook(Beers)
codebook(Breweries)
```
